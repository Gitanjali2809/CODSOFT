# 🚀 Web Development Projects – CodeSoft Internship Tasks  

During my 1-month internship/task program with **CodeSoft**, I built three frontend projects.  

These projects helped me strengthen my skills in **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**,  
with hands-on experience in **responsive design and interactivity**.  
All three are **hosted live on Netlify**.
